<span data-ttu-id="9ceb5-p101">A read-only message store is one in which neither the MAPI client nor the MAPI spooler can create, modify, or delete the objects in the message store. There are many reasons why you might want to implement a read-only message store. For example, a credit reporting firm could use a read-only store to allow its customers or employees to see but not change individual credit reports. Choosing to make a read-only message store has implications for the structure of the store provider and for the store itself. For example, a read-only message store cannot have an Outbox folder, because then MAPI clients would request that new outgoing messages be created in that folder. Similarly, it is the store provider's responsibility to ensure the integrity of the underlying storage mechanism.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="9ceb5-p101">A read-only message store is one in which neither the MAPI client nor the MAPI spooler can create, modify, or delete the objects in the message store.

Nor does it mean that your store provider never needs write permission to the underlying storage mechanism. In some circumstances those two conditions may apply, but not in the general case of a read-only message store. The level of access that your store provider requires and whether or not your store provider ever changes data in the underlying storage mechanism depends mainly on the specific nature of your store provider.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="9ceb5-p103">The fact that MAPI clients and the MAPI spooler may not be able to create, modify, or delete objects in the message store does not mean that the contents of the underlying storage mechanism never change.

<span data-ttu-id="9ceb5-p105">If your message store provider can never write data to the underlying storage mechanism, it will need to implement these features by using a separate storage mechanism outside of the underlying storage mechanism.

This strategy presents additional difficulties but may be the only feasable way for read-only message store providers to implement some features. For example, keeping the contents of the separate storage mechanism synchronized with the objects in the message store is more difficult than storing the read/unread status directly in the message store itself.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="9ceb5-p105">If your message store provider can never write data to the underlying storage mechanism, it will need to implement these features by using a separate storage mechanism outside of the underlying storage mechanism.
